# NonCanon BattleTech Tools

## Purpose

[Fork of Jeff's BattleTech Tools](https://github.com/jdgwf/battletech-tools), intended for creating non-BT rules compliant 'Mechs.

The purpose of these tools is to have a centralized, accessible set of tools for fanfic 'mech creation and possibly force building.

## Development

Currently the Alpha Strike roster should be ready to use for everyone. The BattleMech creator should be able to create any simple Inner Sphere 'mechs accurately, and some **very simple** clan mechs as of March 2022. Data entry is slow going, but with the creation of the Equipment Editor developer page, it's been quite a bit less daunting.

As I work on the 'mech creator I'm working on a Lance/Star/Binary/Company Manager for Classic BattleTech which will make the SVG record sheets electronic like the Alpha Strike In-Play currently does. What I have planned is dynamite, just hoping it will work on most devices.

### Technology

This application is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) which allows a user to create Alpha Strike Rosters, Classic BattleTech BattleMechs and eventually more! from any device with access to a modern web browser and should be able to be "pinned" to the home screen of any device including Windows 10 and 11. MacOS need not try (and I'm a Mac Laptop user, come on Apple, be a team player in the PWA field :( )

The tools are powered by HTML, Bootstrap 4, TypeScript, and React. All data and logic are then compiled and handled by npm.

There are no server moving parts for the application itself, and I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.
